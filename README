libpurple-mini is a project that tries to simplify the build of libpurple
independently of pidgin.

Currently it's possible to compile a basic library so that other plugins can
link to it easily.

I'm doing this primarily to make it easier to cross-compile msn-pecan to win32.

Next step would be to build a library that clients can actually use, and then
compile essential plugins, such as ssl.
